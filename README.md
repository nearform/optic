Optic is an app that helps you securely generate OTP tokens for 2FA protected npm accounts. It allows auto-publish npm packages using CI.

This repository contains the backend API for the application. Unless you're here on purpose, you're probably looking for the [GitHub action](https://github.com/nearform/optic-release-automation-action) or the [mobile application](https://github.com/nearform/optic-expo).
